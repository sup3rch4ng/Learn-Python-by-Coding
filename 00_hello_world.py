# Lesson 0: Hello, World!
# -----------------------
# Welcome to the "Learn Python by Coding" series!
#
# This repository is designed for beginners who want to learn Python step-by-step.
# Each lesson will:
#   1. Explain a concept in simple words (in comments like this).
#   2. Show code examples that you can run and modify.
#
# Why start with "Hello, World!"?
# In programming, the first program you usually write is one that simply
# prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
# This is a tradition in programming, and it helps you test:
#   - That Python is installed correctly
#   - That you can run a Python file without errors

# Let's write our first Python program:
print("Hello, World!")

# How to run this file:
# 1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal)
# 2. Navigate to the folder containing this file
# 3. Run the command: python 00_hello_world.py
#
# You should see: Hello, World! printed on the screen.
